NOTE: 
The Demoscene.cs script creates all UI elements dynamically in the scene.
It is attached to the Canvas element and will be invokded automatically when you run the Demo scene. 
So, don't be surprised that the demo scene appears empty!                                          

While the scene is running you can inspect the created elements in the Hierarchy view.

You can also create UI elements manually by dragging the prefabs into the Hierarchy view.
                           
All prefabs are intended to be used with the automatic layout system in uGui.
